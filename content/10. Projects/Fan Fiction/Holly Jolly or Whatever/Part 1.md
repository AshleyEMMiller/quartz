# A Letter from the Light Side
Janus *had* been enjoying his book when Logan's letter arrived. Far be be it for the light sides, as they called themselves to slum it and visit Janus and Remus in person. Perish the thought.

Janus spared the envelope a glance as it slid through the door flap. "Remus, mail's here."

Remus popped up from behind the couch. "Ooh, I wonder if it's someone's flayed skin?"

"Too small. Fingernails at the most," Janus replied while flipping a page.

The Duke savaged the envelope for a bit before, "We got invited to a party!"

James narrowed his eves. It wouldn't be a prank, that seemed too pointlessly mean-spirited even for him. Forget about the pack of goodie two shoes upstairs. "Hand it over "

Of course by now the letter was sticky. Because Remus was like a macabre Pigpen and anything he touched was soiled in the worst possible way. Janus' gloves were both an aesthetic choice and a balm for his sanity lest he touch something of Remus' with his bare hands. 

The letter was from Logan and while it reeked of the polite masking of reluctance and Logan's baseline "l don't have feelings nonsense" he was honestly inviting them to the Sides' annual secret Santa. He never had before but given that he used the phrase "your contributions will be greatly appreciated" this is likely some nonsense dillemma Thomas was facing. The boy really needs to ease upon the fretting.

Janus read all the way to the bottom. "There were supposed to be two names for us to bring gifts for." He looked up at Remus, who bore an uncharacteristic *oops* face. "Did you eat it already?"

Remus peered down at the damp paper all over the carpet, remnants of the envelope and the names. 

With a put upon sigh, Janus set aside his book and sifted through the mess with his boot. Remus, surprisingly stood very still and didn't help. He must have really wanted to go to the party. After a few moments, Janus pin pointed the locations of two folded strips of paper, as large as the little misleading slips in fortune cookies. "Alright, found them. Pick one."

Remus snatched up the closest strip and Janus peeled up the second strip between thumb and forefinger. The pen ink was smudged, but still Janus could recognize Logan's tidy script: *Patton*. 

Shit. 

"I got Virgie,"

# Reluctant attendee

Janus paced his room, surrounded by the fading remnants of his half-formed gift ideas. This had to be special or at least meaningful within Logan's non-sense and arbitrary twenty-dollar limit. It had to be a gift that came easily to Janus, leaned on his abilities and somehow oferlapped with something that puffball Patton would not just like, but cherish. 

A stuffy was out of the question, Patton had enough of those and he was best at making them anyway. And a something else just wasn't personal enough. 

Janus was thinking of Patton as an adversary. He left his room, snatching a bottle of mulled wine on his way out to go see how Remus was faring. He probably wasn't having a problem coming up with ideas, he was creativity after all. Not that Janus was jealous or anything. 

He wasn't. 

He sometimes was good to ~~steal ideas from~~ bounce ideas off of. And then invert them into something actually safe, sane and consensual. 

Remus, of course was set up at the common area dining table in full on crafting mode. Janus blinked at the monstrosity taking shape on the table, where they ate food sometimes.

Okay maybe Janus was a little jealous. Remus was so deep into flow he hadn't noticed him. Not until Janus clicked a wineglass on the furthest edge of the table and filled it with wine, which he stoppered immediately and placed on the floor, out of reach of whatever was going across the table's surface. 

Remus looked up, his eyes flashing green as creative energy crackled across his body. He really was giving it his all. A pity, Virgil would likely insult Remus no matter how hard he worked. It rolled off of Remus' back, he was impervious to insults, lucky bastard. But it bothered Janus at least. 

"What did you decide on Remus?"

"I'm making Virgil a friend named ➿⸊❥+✱♾️︙✵⸊+."

"Hmm. Interesting."

"Uh huh. He's from the ✗|‡ ⸊§✣﴿〰️‽✱❡➰⦕⧚ dimension and started life as a neglected pauper but has since risen the ranks of society through cunning and bloodshed."

Janus liked him already. "Fascinating. Why about him made you decide to make him for Virgil?"

"Well I thought about making him a spider, but already has one of those so ➿⸊❥+✱♾️︙✵⸊+ gets to have that spider fuzz and lots of eyes at least."

"There certainly are al lot of eyes."

"The ✗|‡ ⸊§✣﴿〰️‽✱❡➰⦕⧚ dimension has pockets of unfathomable darkness only those with extra eyes can see through them. It's how ➿⸊❥+✱♾️︙✵⸊+ was able to sneak up on his enemies and consume them."

Janus, as a rule, tried not to look too hard and whatever Remus was working on at any given point. It kept things respectful and supportive. But this time, Janus , despite himself took a closer look at the damp fur Remus was shaping into Virgil's new eldritch companion. There were for the most part dark brown and a few strands of grey. Janus looked back at the top of Remus' head as he was bent over his creation like Dr. Frankenstein bringing something to life that should not be brought into this world. 

Janus bit his lip to hold back his laugh before asking, on a hunch, "Remus, buddy, are you using stuff from Joanne Fabrics?"

Remus beamed. "How did you know?"

"Just a guess." 

"Yeah it had been a while since I used stuff from there, so I had lots to work with."

Janus took a sip of his wine. Virgil was going to have kittens.

"How's your gift for Patty Cakes going?"

He considered lying but he'd left his room for inspiration.

And while Janus was a fan of the third option in the "beg, borrow, steal" combo, it was never worth it with Remus who gave freely if a little desperately. 

"It's been a walk in the park," Janus said scowling into his drink.

Remus cocked his head as he shaped the wet hair into another stalk. "You could make him something."

"We don't all have your skill at crafting."

Remus took an eyeball from the table, examined it carefully before slipping it  into the base of the stalk so it peeked out from the hair that framed it like a lid. 

"It doesn't have to be complicated for that puff ball. I saw him tear up over that dumbass card Virgil made him."

"Well I don't want to copy you, giving out another crafted gift."

Remus snorted. "This'll be a showstopper. You couldn't possibly make anything like this."

"You got me there."

One of the other advantages to being around Remus when Janus had a problem was that in addition to his occasionally insightful contributions, when Remus was in the zone, his mere aura tended to spark unconventional connections.

# Maybe a touch too much mulled wine

Janus was excited. He wasn't ashamed to say that. To himself. In his head. His gift was fucking perfect. The others would be impressed at his insight into Patton and then they would get invited to contribute more. It was a perfect plan. 

It was only a perfect plan if they actually made it to the party though. 

"We're going to be late."

Janus snorted and got another bottle of wine from the warmer. It smelled good. All Christmas spices and holiday lies, the veneer of polite family conversations and forced cheer and Santa Claus and "oh you shouldn't haves" and...

"Janus I can't find my shoes."

Janus leaned against the fridge and hollered back, "Where did you have them last?"

"In the vat of shit."

"Don't say that at the party."

"Why?"

"Did you check your vat?"

Silence. 

He loved Remus and his ridiculousness. Silly silly side with his--

"I found them."

"What a surprise,"  Janus muttered into his mug. 

Remus came slopping into the living room, "They were there this whole time."

The absurdity of Remus covered up to his knees in-- in-- was just a touch funnier than usual. Cackling, Janus was half-tempted to let Remus show up like this. But the smell was-- lol no. With a wave he got rid of the mess. 

Remus grinned, not even disappointed that he'd been snapped squeaky clean. Janus grinned back. They were going to a party. They never got invited to parties. Remus showed up anyway because his very nature dragged him to where he was least wanted. But Janus -- he didn't need an invitation. He wasn't a vampire. But if it didn't serve his purposes showing up where he wasn't wanted , well it was hard. People wanted their own lies, clung to them like life rafts and wielded them like shields. 

But today, he'd been invited. 

They rose up in Thomas' apartment. 

"We're here!" Janus called out. 

And was promptly hit with a wall of "don't want you here" social deception it made him dizzier than the mulled wine. Patton's fake smile made his eyes sting. Then there was Roman leaning away from his own delighted brother and Virgil sinking out to escape. Well that in particular deserved a drink. 

Janus stuck around though. Because Roman was right, Secret Santa was something to be secretly won. And Janus would win. Patton would love his gift.
