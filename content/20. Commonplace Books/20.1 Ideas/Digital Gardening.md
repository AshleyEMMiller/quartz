# An overview
Digital Gardens are similar to a blog, but are thematic, constantly updated and living websites [^Le Cunff - Digital Garden]. A collection of notes, captures, finished pieces, and (depending on the tool) doodles, they showcase the creator's work and their behind-the-scenes thinking process. Another characteristic of digital gardens is that they are not chronological but conceptually ordered. Bi-directional linking allows readers to meander across different knowledge paths and ideas. 

Digital Gardens afford the creator a self-owned platform for [[Learn In Public\|learning in public]] and [[Continuous Improvement\|Continuous Improvement]].

## Mind Gardening
>[!quote] A mind garden is not a mind backyard. It's not about dumping notes in there and forgetting about them.

Ann-Laure Le Cunff articulates the connection between a mind garden and a digital garden in her Ness Labs article [^Le Cunff - Mind Gardening] She begins with the French expression for "tend to your internal garden" as a metaphor for taking care of your mind. She considers it from the perspective of cognition and knowledge (which is relevant to this context) but I'd be curious about other ways to apply the term and concept. 


She emphasizes the importance of exploration and eureka moments, note making in your own words, mindful consumption from diverse sources, developing unique perspectives and consistency. I particularly like the quite above about the mind garden not being a mind back yard. (Out backyard often is left to its own devices and there are corners that I forget about until the young dog weedles her way into it and then it becomes My Problem™️.)

Le Cunff leans into the horticultural metaphors (which a few other digital gardening writers have also done). She describes "reading broad content" as a way to "plant many seeds", you can generate new ideas by "replanting stems and cuttings from existing ideas", and you can get the word out by sharing "seeds with fellow gardeners". 

The article ends with insights into taking the mind gardening approach and making it tangible and public-facing with a digital garden. There are five examples of influential digital gardens and Le Cunff references Maggie Appleton's list of digital gardens. 

One thing I disagree with is Le Cunff's idea of only migrating completed "evergreen notes" to the public digital garden. Or perhaps I have a different idea of what an evergreen note is. But I prefer the idea of being able to share developing ideas in the digital garden as a way of showing your thinking and learning.

## My Approach Digital Gardening
From my reading, people seem to either be in the "Publish everygreen notes only" or "these notes are an incomplete mess for myself" camp. I'd like to employ a hybrid of the two. Due to the tools I'm using to publish my Obsidian Vault, I'm going to publish each note, one at a time as I've had a chance to look it over. The notes may not be complete, but they will be coherent and have at least one finished thought to them. Since I have to select the notes to publish to the digital garden manually, it gives me a chance to tidy my notes up into something more polished and valuable to my future self. It will also help me unearth old notes that I've forgotten about. I'd like my notes to be valuable to other people, and since I'm more likely to do things for others than myself (accountability), then it will be useful for future me. 

I will have a collection of text notes, photos, Excalidraw visual notes, training logs and more. The wonderful thing about Obsidian is that Editing mode and Reading Mode look different and I can make comments. The comments can be inline and include things like action items or the specific name of a person who told me something (which I may not want to include in my public published notes). 

A consequence of taking the time to create a digital garden is that I realized that a lot of my notes are other peoples thoughts. I don't have a lot of my own writing or synthesis. I write about how I want to process my notes and spend so much time thinking about workflow that I don't actually do the work. So, the Digital Gardening process will force me to write out what I have floating around in my head so I can make it concrete, interrogate it and share it for feedback.
